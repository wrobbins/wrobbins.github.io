      Hello! You probably want to know a little more about me.
      Check out some of my repositories to get an idea.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      I like to keep up with the industry and keep my axe
      <a href="https://github.com/wrobbins/axe-sharpening">sharp</a>.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      I wanted to check out Rust so I wrote a simple CLI program
      called <a href="https://github.com/wrobbins/quoter">quoter</a>
      to help me understand it. I use it for quick stock quotes without
      having to go to a website or open an app on my phone.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      I have been getting into optimizing how I receive content. I have a
      POC project in a private repository, called Digester, that creates
      RSS and HTML summaries of subreddits I am interested in. Let me know if you
      would like to know more.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      In addition to receiving content in a better way, I want to make it easier
      on to read. I am researching tools to create <span>MOBI</span> formatted articles
      to send to an e-ink device like the Kindle.
